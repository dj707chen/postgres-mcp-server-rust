# My Notes

Since AI generate / modify the README.md file, I put my notes in this file.

There are two branches:
- main: First try to use `claude code`, prompts and AI responses are saved in files prefixed with "round 00";
- httpMCP: Second try. The first try created MCP server with stdio transport, this try creates HTTP transport, prompts and AI responses are saved in files prefixed with "round 01"
